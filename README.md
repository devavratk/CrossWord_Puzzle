# CrossWord_Puzzle

hand: set of random words consists of 1/3 vowels and 2/3 consonents.
A set of wordlist is provided from which if the i/p word matches, then it is assumed to be valid.
Each letter is declared with some set of points.

This game is like a normal crossword game. However, here we can play it in two modes. 
First, normal user input mode, where user guesses letters and play.

Second, user and computer mode In the second mode, we can choose whether we want user to play a guess of hand or computer to play.
Computer is designed in such a way that it will always take optimal solutions which will give maximum score.

Moreover, if given i/p is a valid word of maximum length possible from the hand, then we get extra 50 points.

Enjoy the game :)
